NOTE: The components are how the developers divide website into smaller portions
instead of saying what page has a problem, now developers can focus on a specific
component and just fix that.
Here is a glossary of (possible) components that the entire web-app will need:

login-component (under ./login/)
signup-component (under ./signup/)
navbar-component (under ./navigation/)
filter-component (under ./filter/)
map-component (under ./map/)
search-component (under ./search/)
requestops-component (under ./reqeust/)
offerops-component (under ./offer/)
userops-component (under ./user/)
userinfo-component (under ./user/)
usernotification-component (under ./user/)
